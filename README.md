* Provided above is the summary of the multi-linear regression created to predict mpg. As seen above the predictor variables vehicle_length and ground_clearance are both significant in predicting mpg of a vehicle. It's also important to note that vehicle weight is significant at a 90% confidence level, markedly less than the two previously mentioned variables.  
* The slope of the regression model is difficult to visualize because each variable is representative of a new dimension, however we can infer that the slope of the line is non-zero since the coefficients are not zero. 
* The adjusted R-squared value is approximately 0.68, which means that our model has created a good line of best fit for the dataset.
